<h2>Music events in Warkworth, Amble, Acklington, Felton and nearby villages. </h2>

The WAAF music calendar has been set up at <a href="northumbriafolk.org.uk/WAAF.html"> northumbriafolk.org.uk/WAAF.html</a> to hold details of music events in local villages. There are two objectives:
<ul>
<li>To help with publicity of local music events
<li>To minimise, but not necessarily avoid, clashes of events.
</ul>

There are a small number of individuals working to promote live music in their villages. They typically have arrangements for local publicity, but this does not necessarily reach other local communities. They are working independently and may not be aware of similar events scheduled nearby.
<p>
The WAAF calendar provides a mechanism for them to easily share planned dates of events. Within each village an individual (or two) will be given access to update the calendar. They will however need access to a gmail account as the calendar is based on Google software.
<p>
Anyone can view the calendar at the above web page and therefore can see what music events are taking place in the local villages. Event organisers might consider looking at this when scheduling their future events although it is recognised that dates are sometimes imposed by the artist/promoter. Some clashes will still take place, but people will be aware of the problem in advance.

A condition of entering events in the calendar is that you help promote its existence. It should also be publicised in all our local village magazines. 
<h2>What sort of event can be entered</h2>
The mechanism has been set up to support village halls and similar running one off events. It is not intended for regular activities and not intended for commercial sites that have well established publicity mechanisms. The target area is Warkworth, Amble, Acklington, Felton and nearby villages. There&rsquo;s always another location nearby that will stretch the area covered. If stretched too far then this may not be the right mechanism. It is intended for music events, but this can be extended to other productions that have a significant music content. Weekend events slightly further afield can be considered so that local organisers are aware of the possible clash.
<p>
It&rsquo;s difficult to set hard boundaries, so individual editors will be responsible for interpreting the above and acting accordingly.
<p>
<h2>Updating the Calendar</h2>
If you have been granted update access you can make changes using your gmail account. Just add dates to the diary and make sure you include title, location and description. Under description you can provide text or better still an address of a web page containing full event information. You can include the time alongside the date, but personally I prefer not. I think it shows up better on the calendar and the timing is available on the linked web page. Have a play around and decide yourself. Your updates will magically appear on the web site at www.northumbriafolk.org.uk/WAAF.html . <p>
<hr>
This is a new system thus dates may initially be sparse. Usage will be reviewed in August to determine how well it is working and whether any changes are required. <em>If you would like access to update the calendar please contact Peter Burnham, details below.
